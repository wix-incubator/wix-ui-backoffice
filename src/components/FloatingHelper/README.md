This is a Popover helper component

### Open/Close behavior
This component can be Controlled or Uncontrolled according to wether the `opened` property is defined or undefined.
In Uncontrolled mode, the default behavior is that the popover content is opened when mouse-enter is triggered on the target, an closes when the close button is clicked.

### Programatic Open/Close
Works only in Uncontrolled mode.
